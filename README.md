## Technologies

## Languages, frameworks, various tools
This application uses Javascript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap

## Challenges
This assignment was challenging all around.  Functions are crazy and trying to tie all that we have learned together is a big task.

## Your experience building this app
This app took me a while to complete as it is hard to work on things piecemeal.  I am finding that trying to do this part time while working is harder than I thought, but I am learning each day so that is good.

## What was difficult
Trying to remember all the right syntax.

## What did you learn
I learned more about functions and localStorage

## How did you go about solving a problem
Many, times I had to Google items to further my knowledge in a topic.  Thank ngoodness for all the people who like to post things online.
